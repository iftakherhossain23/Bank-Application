# Bank Application :dollar:
This is a bank application created in Java with a frontend interface made using the JavaFX framework. The application provides functionality for both the "manager" and a "customer" of the bank. The manager can add and delete customer accounts, while customers can perform transactions with their account. The backend of the application stores user accounts and balances.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles were applied in the development of this application. The State design pattern was used to design the behavioural structure, which is detailed in the unified modelling language (UML) class diagram below. Furthermore, the use case diagram below highlights the functionality for both actors of the application, the manager and the customer.
